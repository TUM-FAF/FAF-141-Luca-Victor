I've made a boot loader which displays "Hi my name is Vitiok".
In order to do that I've written an assembler language script and compiled it into an image with .img extension. 
There was created a virtual machine and added a Floppy Controller using image previously created.
After selecting image and booting vm it displayed "Hi my name is Vitiok."
It was awesome!
